	<h1>about zzcxz</h1>
	<h2 id="what is zzcxz">what is zzcxz?</h2>
	<p>
	zzcxz consists of user generated, fictional content. do not believe what you read, for it is not real and could be written by anyone.
	</p>

	<h2 id="rules">zzcxz rules</h2>
	<p>
	all content posted to zzcxz MUST UNCONDITIONALLY follow these rules:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>
	no bigotry. do not use zzcxz to harass others.

	<li>
	no graphic, sexual, or gross-out content

	<li>
	interesting themes are fine, but avoid especially serious ones, e.g. mental health

	</ul>
	<p>
	these rules are still important but less so:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>
	be creative

	<li>
	tell the story; do not submit non-sequitur nonsense

	<li>
	maintain continuity between previous events; do not suddenly start telling a completely different story or try to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity">retcon</a> previous events.

	</ul>
	<p>
	by submitting content to zzcxz, you <span class="important">acquiesce it to the public domain</span>. be warned that it may be copied arbitrarily.
	</p>

	<h2 id="editing">how do I edit/remove content?</h2>
	<p>
	once content is posted, it can only be modified by me (the site administrator). I will fix any obvious typos I find. if you want content edited/removed for other reasons, send me an email.
	</p>

	<h2 id="how does the markup work">how does the markup work?</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>
	each line becomes a paragraph.

	<li>
	consecutive lines lines starting with space become code blocks (potentially useful for text chat logs or such).

	<li>
	surround text in square brackets to <code>[emphasize it as important]</code>.

	<li>
	type <code>#REDIRECT &lt;room&gt;</code> on its own line to cause the action to bring you to <code>&lt;room&gt;</code> instead of a new room. replace <code>&lt;room&gt;</code> with the five letters at the end of the url of the desired room.

	<li>
	by default, a title at the top of the page contains the action which brings you to the room. this title can be overridden with <code>#PAGETITLE &lt;title&gt;</code>.

	<li>
	you can add <code>/raw</code> to the end of the URL of a room to see its markup (on the lines starting with tab) (<a href="/g/zzcxz/raw">example</a>). this feature could also potentially be utilized to implement third-party interfaces.

	</ul>

	<p>if you use special formatting, and you see the literal characters that you intend to use to invoke special formatting, you have an error in your formatting. for instance, you should never see "#REDIRECT" in the preview.</p>

	<h2 id="if-you-die">if you die in zzcxz, do you die in real life?</h2>
	<p>
	no, you will not die in real life.
	</p>

	<h2 id="who is john">who is john?</h2>
	<p>
	I don't know.
	</p>

	<h2 id="help">help. help. help. help.</h2>
	<p>
	if you are reading this, it is already too lateâ„¢.
